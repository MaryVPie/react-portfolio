`Hello World!` 
My name is Mariia and this is my web development portfolio build using my new React skills.

## What's included

This application uses React to render content. 
There are 4 components  `Header` appears on multiple pages, `Navigation` within it that’s used to conditionally render About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections, `Project` uses multiple times in the Portfolio section and `Footer` appears on multiple pages.


## Links to Review
