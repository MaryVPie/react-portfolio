This application uses React to render content. 
There are 4 components  `Header` appears on multiple pages, `Navigation` within it thatâ€™s used to conditionally render About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections, `Project` uses multiple times in the Portfolio section and `Footer` appears on multiple pages.
